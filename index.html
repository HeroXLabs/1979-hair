        <h1>History</h1>
          <h3 class='title'></h3>
            <p>Our story began when the founder of Studio 79, Aaron Li, professionally trained by Vidal Sassoon and Toni & Guy, was finishing a styling for his client. He realized that none of the wax, clay and hairspray that he was currently using for his clients met his standards for perfection. The products were either too shiny, not strong enough and didn’t hold, or they were hard to wash off, often leaving unwanted sticky and visible residue on the hair. He set out on a journey to creat a product that would revolutionize hairstyling routine. Ambitious and determined to challenge himself, Aaron started his research and bought countless books and hair products. He also continued his education of the knowledge of the physiology of hair types from around the world. </p>
            <p>Despite numerous attempts and failures, Aaron stayed open-minded and focused, undeterred by his obstacle. After achieving the results he was content with, he teamed up with two labora-tories in California to manufacture the very first product of the 1979 Collection product line-Molding Hair Clay, a Hybrid of wax and clay.</p>
